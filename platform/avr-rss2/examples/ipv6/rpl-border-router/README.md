An IP64/NAT GW
==============

This project is heavily based on the rpl-border-router in the example 
directory. This work is done Contiki/Thingsquare. 

Rather than slip an interface based enc28j60 is added and the SPI-glue 
need is added here.


See the README.ETHERNET.md for ethernet module info.
